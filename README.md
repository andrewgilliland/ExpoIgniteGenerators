Running ignite-cli generators:

- generate - the Ignite command to run
- tab - the template directory to utilize
- ignite - the NAME of our component
- case=none - says just name my file as provided in NAME
- dir - where in Expo router's file-based location should this file live

```bash
npx ignite-cli@latest generate tab ignite --case=none --dir="app/(tabs)"
```
